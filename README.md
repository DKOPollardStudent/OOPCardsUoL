Card Shuffle OOP Assignment - University of Lincoln

A Simple Card Shuffle and Dealing Program

Changes after first review (Second Commit):
- Added "try" error handling to "ShuffleType" in Testing.cs
- Added more comments, notabley to "public Pack()", as well as other places too
- Made variable names more uniform

Notable Issues:
- For some reason, it now exits the VS console after inputting a deal amount, despite no changes to that part of the code.
- I don't know why this happens or how to fix it.
